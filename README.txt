What are european stock options?
An european stock option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying stock in the future at a price that is already fixed today. The right to buy / sell the underlying is termed call / put. The in advance fixed price to buy/sell the underlying is called strike price.

Binominal option pricing model
We use a binominal model approach to approximate option prices. The binomial option pricing model uses an iterative procedure, allowing for the specification of nodes (points in time) during the time span between the valuation date and the option's expiration date. A binominal model can be visualized graphically by a binominal tree. The binomial tree consists of possible intrinsic values that an option may take at different nodes or time periods. The number n determines the number of iterations between today and the expiration date of the option
